[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS)

CORS is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.  The preflight checks which HTTP method are supported with HTTP OPTIONS request method.   

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. 

CORS failures result in errors but for security reasons, specifics about the error are not available to JavaScript. All the code knows is that an error occurred, Then only way to determine what specifically went wrong is to look at the browser's console for details. 

CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery

CSRF is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands. This can be done including malicious parameters in a URL behind a link that supports to go somewhere else. 

An example of the full exchange between client and server. Request/Response

```HTTP
OPTIONS /doc HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.other
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0

Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

```

Once the preflight request is complete, the real request is sent:

```HTTP
POST /doc HTTP/1.1
