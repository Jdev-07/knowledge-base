Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents such as HTML. It was made for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more. 

HTTP follows a classical client-server model with a client opening a request, then waiting until it receives a response from the server. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any sessions data between two requests, although the later addition of cookies adds state to some client-server interactions.

[[HTTP headers]]

Message headers are used to send metadata about a resource or HTTP message, and to describe the behavior of the client or the server

[[Cross-Origin Resources Sharing (CORS)]]

Cross-site HTTP requests are requests for resources from different domain than that of the resource making the request.
