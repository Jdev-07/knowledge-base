# Linux Basics
## The Terminal

The terms ‚Äúterminal,‚Äù ‚Äúshell,‚Äù and ‚Äúcommand line interface‚Äù are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them:

- A¬†_terminal_¬†is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell.
- A¬†_shell_¬†is a program that exposes the computer‚Äôs operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter.
- A¬†_command line interface_¬†is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results.

When someone refers to one of these three terms in the context of Linux, they generally mean a terminal environment where you can run commands and see the results printed out to the terminal

- **Terminal** ‚Üí Think of it as the "window" or "app" where you type commands. It‚Äôs just the environment where you interact.
    
- **Shell** ‚Üí This is the actual program that takes what you type, understands it, and tells the computer what to do. (Examples: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell).
    
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** ‚Üí This is the style of interaction where you type text commands instead of clicking buttons.

### netstat

netstat (short for network statistics) is a command-line tool that shows network connections, routing tables, interface stats, and more.

Basically, it tells you what‚Äôs happening on your network:

- What connections are open
    
- Which ports are being used
    
- Which apps/processes are using the network

**üí° Uses**

1. List all listening ports

To list all listening ports, using both TCP and UDP, use¬†`netstat -a`:

![[knowledge-base/Cloud Computing/GCP/Learning Path/Linux/images/linux-001.png]]

2. List only TCP port connections

If you found the¬†`-a`¬†option to be too verbose, try the¬†`-t`¬†flag with it:

![[knowledge-base/Cloud Computing/GCP/Learning Path/Linux/images/linux-002.png]]
3. List only UDP connections

The same filter¬†can be used to pull UDP connections down. Seen here:

![[linux-003.png]]
4. List all actively listening ports

To list all actively listening ports (both TCP and UDP), use the following command:

5. Show all actively listening ports only

![[linux-004.png]]

6. Pull stats by protocol

7. Show routing table

8. Show numeric address/ports

### curl

curl stands for **Client URL**.  
It‚Äôs a command-line tool to **transfer data from or to a server**, using many protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, etc.

üëâ Unlike `wget` (mostly for downloading files), `curl` is more about **interacting with APIs and web servers**.

 **üöÄ Common options**

- `-O` ‚Üí save file with original name.
    
- `-o` ‚Üí save file with custom name.
    
- `-L` ‚Üí follow redirects.
    
- `-I` ‚Üí show headers only.
    
- `-d` ‚Üí send POST data.
    
- `-H` ‚Üí add custom header.
    
- `-u` ‚Üí username/password login.

### netcat

netcat is known as the **‚ÄúSwiss army knife of networking‚Äù** üõ†Ô∏è.  
It lets you **read and write data across network connections**, using TCP or UDP.

You can use it to:

- Test connectivity between machines
    
- Transfer files
    
- Open a chat between two computers
    
- Debug network services
    
- Create simple servers

Basic usage

```Bash
nc [options] <host> <port>
```
