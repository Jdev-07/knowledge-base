Cloud Computing a delivery model for services like:
* Storage: Structured and unstructured data
* Compute Power: Virtual Machines
* Networking: To connect your resources
* Analytics: Performance data and telemetry

## Key Characteristics 

### Scalability

The scalability can be vertical or horizontal scaling. If you are adding more compute power, that means vertical scaling or scaling up. However, if you remove the compute power you are scaling down. 

On the other hand, if you increase the amount of resources, you are scaling horizontally (scaling out). I contra part, if you decrease the number of resources, you are scaling in. 

Scalability is the ability yo scale. Scaling is  a process of:
* Allocating (adding)
* Deallocating (removing)

### Elasticity

Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically. In other works, is the ability to automatically scale based on incoming traffic or workload.

### Agility

Agility is the ability to react quickly. Agility is the ability to allocate and deallocate(scale) resources quickly

### Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures

### Disaster Recovery

Disaster is serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes. 

Disaster recovery is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service using copies of the service for instance. 

### High Availability

The availability is the calculation between uptime / uptime + downtime.

The availability is a measure of system uptime for users/services.

High Availability is the ability yo keep services running for extended periods of time with very litter downtime.
