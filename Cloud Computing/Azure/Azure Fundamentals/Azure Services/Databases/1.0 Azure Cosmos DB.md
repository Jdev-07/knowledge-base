Azure Cosmos DB is a **fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database** designed for mission-critical applications. It supports NoSQL, relational, and vector data models, making it ideal for modern apps, including AI-powered solutions.

## Key Benefits

- **Global Distribution**: Replicate data across any Azure region with just a few clicks.
- **Low Latency**: Sub-10ms read/write latency backed by SLAs.
- **Elastic Scalability**: Automatically scale throughput and storage based on demand.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Work with document, key-value, graph, column-family, and relational data.
- **Fully Managed**: No need to worry about patching, backups, or updates.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC, and compliance with major standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
