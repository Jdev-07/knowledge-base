Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are like physical disks in an on-premises server, but they're virtualized. With managed disks, you only have to specify the disk type and the disk size, then provision the disk. After you provision the disk, Azure handles the rest.

There are five types of managed disks: Ultra Disks, Premium solid-state drives (SSD) v2, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard hard disk drives (HDD). To learn about each disk type and decide which fits your needs, see [Azure managed disk types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types).

An alternative is to use Azure Elastic SAN as the storage for your virtual machine (VM). With Elastic SAN, you can consolidate the storage for all your workloads into a single storage back end. Elastic SAN can be more cost effective if you have many large-scale, I/O-intensive workloads and top-tier databases.
