## What is Azure Blob storage?

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's **object storage** solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of **unstructured data**. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

Blob Storage is designed for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Writing to log files.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- **Storing data for analysis** by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Users or client applications can access objects in Blob Storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. Objects in Blob Storage are accessible via the [Azure Storage REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api), [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage), [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage), or an Azure Storage client library. Client libraries are available for different languages

Clients can also securely connect to Blob Storage by using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and mount Blob Storage containers by using the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol.

## About Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Blob Storage supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft's enterprise big data analytics solution for the cloud. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 offers a hierarchical file system as well as the advantages of Blob Storage, including:

- Low-cost, tiered storage
- High availability
- Strong consistency
- Disaster recovery capabilities

## Blob Storage resources

Blob Storage offers three types of resources:

- The **storage account**
- A **container** in the storage account
- A **blob** in a container

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

![[blob-001.png]]

### Storage accounts

A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Blob Storage endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account..

The following table describes the different types of storage accounts that are supported for Blob Storage:

|Type of storage account|Performance tier|Usage|
|---|---|---|
|General-purpose v2|Standard|Standard storage account type for blobs, file shares, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Blob Storage or one of the other Azure Storage services.|
|Block blob|Premium|Premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transaction rates or that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency. [Learn more about workloads for premium block blob accounts...](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-block-blob-premium)|
|Page blob|Premium|Premium storage account type for page blobs only. [Learn more about workloads for premium page blob accounts...](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview)|


### Containers

A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.

A container name must be a valid DNS name, as it forms part of the unique URI (Uniform resource identifier) used to address the container or its blobs. Follow these rules when naming a container:

- Container names can be between 3 and 63 characters long.
- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Two or more consecutive dash characters aren't permitted in container names.

The URI for a container is similar to:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer`

### Blobs

Azure Storage supports three types of blobs:

- **Block blobs** store text and binary data. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually. Block blobs can store up to about 190.7 TiB.
- **Append blobs** are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios such as logging data from virtual machines.
- **Page blobs** store random access files up to 8 TiB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure virtual machines. For more information about page blobs, see [Overview of Azure page blobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview)

## Types of storage accounts

Azure Storage offers several types of storage accounts. Each type supports different features and has its own pricing model.

The following table describes the types of storage accounts recommended by Microsoft for most scenarios.

|Type of storage account|Supported storage services|Redundancy options|Usage|
|---|---|---|---|
|Standard general-purpose v2|Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage1), Queue Storage, Table Storage, and Azure Files|Locally redundant storage (LRS) / geo-redundant storage (GRS) / read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)  <br>  <br>Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) / geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) / read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)2|Standard storage account type for blobs, file shares, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage. If you want support for network file system (NFS) in Azure Files, use the premium file shares account type.|
|Premium block blobs3|Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage1)|LRS  <br>  <br>ZRS2|Premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transaction rates or that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency. [Learn more about example workloads.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-block-blob-premium)|
|Premium file shares3|Azure Files|LRS  <br>  <br>ZRS2|Premium storage account type for file shares only. Recommended for enterprise or high-performance scale applications. Use this account type if you want a storage account that supports both Server Message Block (SMB) and NFS file shares.|

### Data Redundancy 

### Disaster Recovery and Failover

Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data to protect it from planned and unplanned events. Examples of these events include transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.

When deciding which redundancy option is best for your scenario, consider the tradeoffs between lower costs and higher availability. The factors that help determine which redundancy option you should choose include:

- How your data is replicated within the primary region.
- Whether your data is replicated from a primary region to a second, geographically distant region, to protect against regional disasters (geo-replication).
- Whether your application requires read access to the replicated data in the secondary region during an outage in the primary region (geo-replication with read access).

The services that comprise Azure Storage are managed through a common Azure resource called a _storage account_. The storage account represents a shared pool of storage that can be used to deploy storage resources such as blob containers (Blob Storage), file shares (Azure Files), tables (Table Storage), or queues (Queue Storage). For more information about Azure Storage accounts, see [Storage account overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

The redundancy setting for a storage account is shared for all storage services exposed by that account. All storage resources deployed in the same storage account have the same redundancy setting. Consider isolating different types of resources in separate storage accounts if they have different redundancy requirements.

### Redundancy in a primary region

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:

- **Locally redundant storage (LRS)** replicates your data three times within a single physical location (datacenter) in the primary region. It does not replicate across availability zones.
- **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)** copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for Azure Data Lake Storage workloads.

#### Locally redundant storage 

Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates the data within your storage accounts to one or more Azure availability zones located in the primary region of your choice. Although there is no option to choose your preferred availability zone, Azure may move or expand LRS accounts across zones to improve load balancing. LRS provides at least 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability of objects over a given year. Visit the [What are Azure availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) article to learn more about availability zone reliability.

LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. However, if a disaster such as fire or flooding occurs within the data center, all replicas of a storage account using LRS might be lost or unrecoverable. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends using [zone-redundant storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#zone-redundant-storage) (ZRS), [geo-redundant storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#geo-redundant-storage) (GRS), or [geo-zone-redundant storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#geo-zone-redundant-storage) (GZRS).

A write request to a storage account that is using LRS happens synchronously. The write operation returns successfully only after the data is written to all three replicas.

The following diagram shows how your data is replicated within a single data center with LRS:

![[blob-002.png]]

LRS is a good choice for the following scenarios:

- If your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs, consider choosing LRS.
- If your application is restricted to replicating data only within a region due to data governance requirements, consider choosing LRS. In some cases, the paired regions across which the data is geo-replicated might be within another region. For more information on paired regions, see [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/).
- If your scenario is using Azure unmanaged disks, consider using LRS. While it's possible to create a storage account for Azure unmanaged disks that uses GRS, it isn't recommended due to potential issues with consistency over asynchronous geo-replication.

#### Zone redundant storage 

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates the data within your storage accounts to three or more Azure availability zones located in the primary region of your choice. Each availability zone is a separate physical location with independent power, cooling, and networking. ZRS offers durability for storage resources of at least 99.9999999999% (12 9s) over a given year. Visit the [What are Azure availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) article to learn more about availability zone reliability.

When you utilize ZRS, your data remains accessible for both read and write operations even if a zone becomes unavailable. If a zone becomes unavailable, Azure undertakes networking updates such as Domain Name System (DNS) repointing. These updates could affect your application if you access data before the updates are complete. When designing applications for ZRS, follow practices for transient fault handling, including implementing retry policies with exponential back-off.

A write request to a storage account that is using ZRS happens synchronously. The write operation returns successfully only after the data is written to all replicas across the three availability zones. If an availability zone is temporarily unavailable, the operation returns successfully after the data is written to all available zones.

Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for scenarios that require high availability. ZRS is also recommended for restricting replication of data to a particular region to meet data governance requirements.

Microsoft recommends using ZRS for Azure Files workloads. If a zone becomes unavailable, no remounting of Azure file shares from the connected clients is required.

The following diagram shows how your data is replicated across availability zones in the primary region with ZRS:

![[blob-003.png]]

ZRS provides excellent performance, low latency, and resiliency for your data if it becomes temporarily unavailable. However, ZRS by itself might not fully protect your data against a regional disaster where multiple zones are permanently affected. [Geo-zone-redundant storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#geo-zone-redundant-storage) (GZRS) uses ZRS in the primary region and also geo-replicates your data to a secondary region. GZRS is available in many regions, and is recommended for protection against regional disasters.

The archive tier for Blob Storage isn't currently supported for ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS accounts. Unmanaged disks don't support ZRS or GZRS.

### Redundancy in a secondary storage

Redundancy options can help provide high durability for your applications. In many regions, you can copy the data within your storage account to a secondary region located hundreds of miles away from the primary region. Copying your storage account to a secondary region ensures that your data remains durable during a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable.

When you create a storage account, you select the primary region for the account. The paired secondary region is determined based on the primary region, and can't be changed. For more information about regions supported by Azure, see the [Azure regions list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list#azure-regions-list-1).

Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:

- **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** copies your data synchronously three times within one or more Azure availability zones in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS.

![[blob-004.png]]

- **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)** copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region using ZRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS.

![[blob-005.png]]

The primary difference between GRS and GZRS is how data is replicated in the primary region. Within the secondary region, data is always replicated synchronously three times using LRS. LRS in the secondary region protects your data against hardware failures.

When you utilize GRS or GZRS, the data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there's a failover to the secondary region. For read access to the secondary region, configure your storage account to use read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS). For more information, see [Read access to data in the secondary region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#read-access-to-data-in-the-secondary-region).

If the primary region becomes unavailable, you can choose to fail over to the secondary region. After the failover operation completes, the secondary region becomes the primary region and you're able to read and write data. For more information on disaster recovery and to learn how to fail over to the secondary region, see [Disaster recovery and storage account failover](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance).

Azure Files does not support read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).
