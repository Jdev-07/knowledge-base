- [Azure Blobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction): A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage.
- [Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction): Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- [Azure Elastic SAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction): A fully integrated solution that simplifies deploying, scaling, managing, and configuring a SAN in Azure.
- [Azure Queues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction): A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- [Azure Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview): A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
- [Azure managed Disks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview): Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
- [Azure Container Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction): A volume management, deployment, and orchestration service built natively for containers.

Each service is accessed through a storage account with a unique address.
