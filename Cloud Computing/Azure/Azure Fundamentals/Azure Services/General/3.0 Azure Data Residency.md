## üåç What Is Azure Data Residency?

**Data residency** refers to the **physical location** where customer data is stored and processed. In Azure, this means you can choose the **region or geography** where your data lives‚Äîcritical for meeting **regulatory, privacy, and sovereignty requirements**.

## üß© Key Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Regional Deployment**|Most Azure services let you choose the region for data storage and processing|
|**Geo-boundaries**|Data stays within the selected geography unless explicitly configured otherwise|
|**Encryption & Security**|Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using FIPS 140-2 compliant protocols|
|**Compliance Support**|Azure supports GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and other global standards|
|**Customer Control**|You own your data and control replication, access, and deletion|
|**Extended Zones**|For low-latency and strict residency, Azure offers metro-specific zones|

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Sovereignty

- Azure offers **data residency in over 35 countries**, more than any other cloud provider.
- With **Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty**, you can configure **Sovereign Landing Zones (SLZs)** to restrict services and regions for public sector or regulated industries.
- Azure‚Äôs **Global Network** ensures encrypted data transfers between regions, but **customer data replication across geos only happens with authorization**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions to Regional Storage

Some services may store or process data **outside the selected region**, such as:

- Azure Cloud Services (deployment packages backed up to the U.S.)
- Azure Databricks (identity info stored in the U.S.)
- Azure OpenAI (global model deployments may process prompts outside selected Geo)

## üìå Best Practices

- Use **geo-redundant storage** within the same geography for resilience.
- Configure **network security groups and firewalls** to restrict access by location.
- For sensitive workloads, consider **Azure Extended Zones** or **Sovereign Cloud configurations**.
