Overview

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a cloud-native disaster recovery service that orchestrates replication, failover, and failback of workloads—whether they’re running on Azure VMs, on-premises VMware/Hyper-V VMs, or physical servers. By continuously replicating data to a secondary Azure region (or on-premises site), ASR helps ensure your business apps stay online during planned maintenance and unexpected outages. When a disruption occurs, you trigger a failover to Azure with minimal data loss and then fail back once your primary site is healthy.

Key Benefits

- Minimize downtime by keeping recovery point objectives (RPOs) as low as 30 seconds and recovery time objectives (RTOs) within organizational limits.
- Eliminate costly secondary datacenter infrastructure—pay only for the compute and storage you need in Azure.
- Simplify disaster recovery testing with non-disruptive “Test Failover” drills.
- Orchestrate complex, multi-tier application recoveries using customizable recovery plans with runbooks and scripts.
- Achieve compliance and security with built-in encryption, role-based access control, and support for industry certifications.
- Scale coverage across any number of mission-critical workloads—automatically updated as new Azure features roll out.

Core Features

- Workload Replication  
    • Azure VMs region-to-region  
    • On-premises VMware, Hyper-V, physical servers, Azure Stack VMs, AWS Windows instances
- Continuous Data Replication  
    • Near-zero RPO for VMs  
    • Hyper-V: configurable 30 s or 5 min snapshot intervals
- Application-Consistent Snapshots  
    • Capture in-memory data and pending transactions for consistent recoveries
- Flexible Failover Options  
    • Planned failovers with zero data loss  
    • Unplanned failovers minimizing data loss per replication frequency
- Recovery Plans  
    • Sequence multi-VM or multi-tier app recoveries  
    • Integrate pre- and post-failover scripts, Azure Automation runbooks
- Non-Disruptive Testing  
    • Validate DR plans without impacting production
- Network & Resource Integration  
    • Auto-provision Azure VNETs, load balancers, and Traffic Manager settings
- Monitoring & Automation  
    • Built-in alerts via Azure Monitor  
    • REST APIs for automation and at-scale governance.

Most Important Information

Below is a summary of ASR’s critical attributes:

|Attribute|Details|
|---|---|
|Supported Workloads|Azure VMs, VMware & Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, Azure Stack, AWS Windows instances|
|Replication Frequency|Continuous replication; Hyper-V snapshots every 30 s or 5 min|
|RPO/RTO|RPO as low as 30 s; RTO depends on recovery plan and workload|
|Pricing Model|Pay-per-protected-instance plus storage consumption; no data transfer fees in Azure-to-Azure DR|
|Recovery Plans|Orchestrate multi-VM application failover with scripts and runbooks|

Key Differences ASR and Azure Backup

|Aspect|Azure Site Recovery|Azure Backup|
|---|---|---|
|Primary Use Case|Disaster recovery and business continuity|Data protection and restore|
|Target Scope|Entire VMs, multi-tier applications, physical servers|Individual files, folders, disks, VMs, databases|
|Recovery Objective|Low RPO (as low as 30 s) and RTO driven by orchestration|RPO depends on backup schedule; RTO driven by restore speed|
|Replication vs. Snapshot|Continuous replication to secondary site/region|Incremental snapshots stored in Recovery Services vault|
|Failover Orchestration|Customizable recovery plans with scripts and runbooks|No built-in orchestration; restores are manual or scripted|
|Testing|Non-disruptive Test Failover|Recovery drill via restore validation|
|Retention and Immutability|Short-term replication data, no long-term retention|Short-term, long-term, immutable vault (WORM) options|
|Pricing Model|Pay per protected instance + storage consumption|Pay per protected instance + storage consumption|
|Typical SLA|RPO ≤ 30 s; RTO depends on plan|RPO depends on policy; RTO depends on restore time|
