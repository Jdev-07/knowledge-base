Overview

Azure Backup is a cloud-native backup-as-a-service solution that provides simple, secure, and cost-effective data protection for on-premises and Azure workloads. It automates backup scheduling, storage management, and retention policies, enabling seamless recovery of files, folders, applications, and entire virtual machines without deploying or managing backup infrastructure.

Key Benefits

- Offload on-premises backup to the cloud, eliminating complex on-prem hardware and software requirements
- Protect Azure Virtual Machines with independent, geo-redundant recovery points stored in a Recovery Services vault
- Scale elastically to handle any backup volume—no limits on inbound or outbound data transfer and no extra infrastructure to manage
- Secure data in transit and at rest with AES-256 encryption and support for customer-managed keys
- Centralized monitoring, alerting, and reporting via the Recovery Services vault and Azure Monitor integration
- Application-consistent backups for VMs and workloads, reducing recovery time and ensuring data integrity
- Flexible retention: short-term, long-term, and immutable vault options for compliance and ransomware protection

Core Features

- **Recovery Services Vaults**: Central storage entities that hold backup copies, recovery points, and backup policies for multiple workloads
- **Workload Support**:

- Files & Folders on Windows servers using MARS agent
- Azure VMs with VM extension (Windows/Linux)
- Azure Managed Disks via Disk Backup
- SQL Server and SAP HANA in Azure VMs
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL flexible servers
- Azure Files and Azure Blobs vaulted backup (preview)

- **Backup Policies**: Define backup schedules (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) and retention durations (short-term, long-term) across vaults
- **Incremental Snapshots**: High-efficiency, crash-consistent backups that transfer only changed blocks, minimizing storage and network usage
- **Multiple Redundancy Options**: Locally redundant storage (LRS), zone-redundant storage (ZRS), and geo-redundant storage (GRS) to meet durability and compliance needs
- **Soft Delete & Immutable Vaults**: Protect against accidental or malicious deletion by retaining deleted backups for 14 days and enforcing write-once storage policies
- **Security & Access Control**:

- Role-based access control with built-in Backup Contributor/Operator/Reader roles
- Multi-user authorization via Resource Guard
- Integration with Azure Key Vault for passphrase protection

- **Monitoring & Automation**: Built-in alerts, metrics, and REST APIs; unified view in Backup Center for enterprise-scale governance
