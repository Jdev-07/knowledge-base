## ‚ö° What Is Azure Event Grid?

**Azure Event Grid** is a **fully managed event routing service** that enables **publish-subscribe messaging** between applications, services, and devices. It supports both **HTTP** and **MQTT protocols**, making it ideal for IoT, serverless, and real-time integration scenarios.

## üß© Core Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MQTT Messaging**          | Supports MQTT v3.1.1 & v5.0 for IoT device communication                |
| **Push & Pull Delivery**    | Push events to endpoints or let subscribers pull them on demand         |
| **Custom Topics**           | Define your own event schema and routing logic                          |
| **Advanced Filtering**      | Route events based on attributes like type, subject, or custom metadata |
| **Event Handlers**          | Integrates with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Event Hubs, Webhooks, etc. |
| **CloudEvents 1.0 Support** | Ensures interoperability across platforms                               |
| **High Throughput**         | Handles millions of events per second with low latency                  |
| **Security & Auth**         | Supports TLS 1.2/1.3, OAuth 2.0 JWT, Entra ID, and X.509 certificates   |

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- **Real-time responsiveness**: React instantly to system changes or user actions
- **Decoupled architecture**: Loosely couple services for better scalability and maintainability
- **IoT integration**: Seamlessly connect millions of devices using MQTT
- **Flexible consumption**: Choose between push or pull models depending on your app‚Äôs needs
- **Built-in reliability**: 24-hour retry with exponential backoff for push delivery
- **Custom domains**: Assign your own domain names to endpoints for secure access

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- Trigger Azure Functions when a blob is uploaded
- Route IoT telemetry to Event Hubs for analytics
- Automate resource tagging or policy enforcement
- Integrate SaaS partner events into your workflows
