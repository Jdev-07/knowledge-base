**Azure Sphere** is a comprehensive IoT security solution that combines:

- A **certified microcontroller unit (MCU)** with built-in security
- A **custom Linux-based OS** designed for embedded security
- A **cloud-based Security Service** that manages updates, authentication, and threat detection

Together, these components create a secure foundation for building and maintaining connected devices.

## üß©Core Components

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Azure Sphere MCU**|A crossover chip with real-time and high-level cores, built for secure IoT|
|**Azure Sphere OS**|A custom Linux-based OS with sandboxing and compartmentalization|
|**Security Service**|Cloud-based service for updates, error reporting, and certificate management|

## üõ°Ô∏è Seven Properties of Highly Secured Devices

Azure Sphere is built around Microsoft‚Äôs seven essential security principles:

1. **Hardware-based root of trust**
2. **Small trusted computing base**
3. **Defense in depth**
4. **Compartmentalization**
5. **Certificate-based authentication**
6. **Failure reporting**
7. **Renewable security**

These ensure that even low-cost devices can be resilient against modern threats.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- **End-to-end security**: From chip to cloud, every layer is protected
- **OTA updates**: Automatic firmware and OS patches without user intervention
- **Cloud integration**: Works with Azure IoT Hub, IoT Central, or other cloud platforms
- **Guardian modules**: Secure legacy devices without redesigning hardware
- **No subscription fees**: One-time cost includes lifetime access to OS and security service

## üß† Use Cases

- Smart appliances (e.g., connected dishwashers)
- Industrial sensors and controllers
- Medical devices and monitors
- Edge computing in critical infrastructure
- Secure retrofitting of legacy equipment
