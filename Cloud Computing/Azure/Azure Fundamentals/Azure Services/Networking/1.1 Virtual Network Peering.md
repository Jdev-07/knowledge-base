Azure Virtual Network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more virtual networks in Azure, making them appear as one for connectivity purposes. This powerful feature allows you to create secure, high-performance connections between virtual networks while keeping all traffic on Microsoft's private backbone infrastructure, eliminating the need for public internet routing.

Azure supports the following types of peering:

- **Virtual network peering**: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.
    
- **Global virtual network peering**: Connect virtual networks across Azure regions.

The benefits of using virtual network peering, whether local or global, include:

- A low-latency, high-bandwidth connection between resources in different virtual networks.
    
- The ability for resources in one virtual network to communicate with resources in a different virtual network.
    
- The ability to transfer data between virtual networks across Azure subscriptions, Microsoft Entra tenants, deployment models, and Azure regions.
    
- The ability to peer virtual networks created through Azure Resource Manager.
    
- The ability to peer a virtual network created through Resource Manager to one created through the classic deployment model. To learn more about Azure deployment models, see [Understand Azure deployment models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-models?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json).
    
- No downtime to resources in either virtual network when you create the peering or after the peering is created.

Network traffic between peered virtual networks is private. Traffic between the virtual networks is kept on the Microsoft backbone network. No public internet, gateways, or encryption are required in the communication between the virtual networks.

## Subnet Peering

Subnet peering refers to a method of connecting two virtual networks by linking the subnet address spaces rather than the entire virtual network address spaces. It lets users specify which subnets are supposed to participate in the peering across the local and remote virtual networks.

Subnet peering is an added flexibility built on top of virtual network peering. Users get an option to choose specific subnets that need to be peered across virtual networks. Users can specify or enter the list of subnets across the virtual networks that they want to peer. In contrast, in regular virtual network peering, entire address space/subnets across the virtual networks get peered.

## Gateway and on-premises connectivity 

Each virtual network, including a peered virtual network, can have its own gateway. A virtual network can use its gateway to connect to an on-premises network. You can also configure [virtual network-to-virtual network connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) by using gateways, even for peered virtual networks.

When you configure both options for virtual network interconnectivity, the traffic between the virtual networks flows through the peering configuration. The traffic uses the Azure backbone.

You can also configure the gateway in the peered virtual network as a transit point to an on-premises network. In this case, the virtual network that's using a remote gateway can't have its own gateway. A virtual network could have only one gateway. The gateway should be either a **local or remote gateway** in the peered virtual network, as shown in the following diagram.

Gateway transit between virtual networks created through different deployment models is supported. The gateway must be in the virtual network in the Azure Resource Manager model. To learn more about using a gateway for transit, see [Configure a VPN gateway for transit in a virtual network peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json).

When you peer virtual networks that share a single ExpressRoute connection, the traffic between them goes through the peering relationship. That traffic uses the Azure backbone network. You can still use local gateways in each virtual network to connect to the on-premises circuit. Otherwise, you can use a shared gateway and configure transit for on-premises connectivity.
