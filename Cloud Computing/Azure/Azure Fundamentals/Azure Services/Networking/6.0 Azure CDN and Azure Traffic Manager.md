# Azure CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers that are close to end users to minimize latency.

CDNs are typically used to deliver static content such as images, style sheets, documents, client-side scripts, and HTML pages. The major advantages of using a CDN are lower latency and faster delivery of content to users, regardless of their geographical location in relation to the datacenter where the application is hosted. CDNs can also help to reduce load on a web application, because the application does not have to service requests for the content that is hosted in the CDN.

Azure Content Delivery Network offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure Content Delivery Network can also accelerate dynamic content, which can't get cached, by using various network optimizations using content delivery network POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

## Key Benefits

- **Faster Load Times**: Content is served from the closest edge node to the user.
- **Global Scalability**: Handles traffic spikes without extra infrastructure.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Minimizes requests to origin servers.
- **Improved User Experience**: Quick page loads and smoother media playback.
- **Built-in Security**: Includes HTTPS support, token authentication, and DDoS protection.

## Core Features

- **Smart Caching**: Stores static content at edge for fast access.
- **File Compression**: Reduces the size of transmitted data.
- **Geo-filtering**: Control access by geographic region.
- **Token Authentication**: Secures content using access tokens.
- **Custom Domain with SSL**: Use your own domain with secure connections.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitor traffic, performance, and usage live.
- **Rules Engine**: Define how content is cached, redirected, or customized

# Azure Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness.

Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct client requests to the appropriate service endpoint based on a traffic-routing method. Traffic manager also provides health monitoring for every endpoint. The endpoint can be any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Traffic Manager provides a range of [traffic-routing methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods) and [endpoint monitoring options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-monitoring) to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Traffic Manager is resilient to failure, including the failure of an entire Azure region.

**Azure Traffic Manager** is a **DNS-based global traffic load balancer**. It doesn’t route traffic itself but uses DNS to direct client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint—based on performance, priority, geography, or other routing methods. It’s ideal for improving **availability**, **performance**, and **resilience** across distributed applications.

## Core Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**DNS-Based Routing**|Operates at the DNS layer to direct traffic before connection is established|
|**Endpoint Monitoring**|Continuously checks health of endpoints and supports automatic failover|
|**Multiple Routing Methods**|Six flexible methods: Priority, Weighted, Performance, Geographic, Subnet, Multi-value|
|**Hybrid Support**|Works with Azure services, on-premises systems, and external endpoints|
|**Nested Profiles**|Combine routing methods for complex deployments|
|**Traffic View**|Visualize user traffic patterns and endpoint performance|
|**No Downtime Maintenance**|Redirects traffic during planned outages|
### Routing Methods Explained

|Method|Use Case|
|---|---|
|**Priority**|Failover scenarios—route to primary unless it’s down|
|**Weighted**|A/B testing or gradual rollout—distribute traffic based on weights|
|**Performance**|Latency-sensitive apps—route to closest endpoint|
|**Geographic**|Compliance or localization—route based on user’s region|
|**Multi-value**|Return multiple healthy endpoints—enhances redundancy|
|**Subnet**|Route based on user IP ranges—custom traffic segmentation|
## Benefits You’ll Appreciate

- **High Availability**: Automatic failover keeps services online even during outages
- **Global Reach**: Distribute traffic across multiple Azure regions or external sites
- **Improved Performance**: Direct users to the lowest-latency endpoint
- **Hybrid Flexibility**: Supports cloud-to-on-prem and multi-cloud scenarios
- **Scalability**: Easily handles growing traffic volumes with intelligent routing
