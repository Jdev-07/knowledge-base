# Service Endpoints

[Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your virtual network to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your virtual network to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

Microsoft recommends use of Azure Private Link and private endpoints for secure and private access to services hosted on the Azure platform. Azure Private Link deploys a network interface into a virtual network of your choosing for Azure services such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL. For more information, see [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) and [What is a private endpoint?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

Service endpoints are available for the following Azure services and regions. The _Microsoft.*_ resource is in parenthesis. Enable this resource from the subnet side while configuring service endpoints for your service:

# Azure Private Link

[Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels through the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers.

Azure Private Link is now generally available. Both Private Endpoint and Private Link service (service behind standard load balancer) are generally available. Different Azure PaaS will onboard to Azure Private Link at different schedules. See [Private Link availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/availability) for an accurate status of Azure PaaS on Private Link. For known limitations, see [Private Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#limitations) and [Private Link Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#limitations)

## Private Endpoint

A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

- Azure Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Your own service, using [Private Link service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview).

### 1. Service Endpoints

- **What it is**: Extends your VNet's private address space to Azure services (like Storage or SQL DB).
    
- **Key points**:
    
    - Traffic stays on the **Microsoft backbone network** (more secure than public internet).
        
    - Uses **public IPs** of the Azure service, but access is restricted to your VNet.
        
    - No additional cost.
        
- **Use case**: "I want to securely connect my VNet to Azure PaaS services without using public internet."
    

### 2. Private Endpoint

- **What it is**: Assigns a **private IP from your VNet** directly to an Azure service (like a Storage Account).
    
- **Key points**:
    
    - Uses **Azure Private Link** technology underneath.
        
    - Traffic stays entirely within Microsoft's network (most secure option).
        
    - The service becomes accessible via private IP (like an on-prem resource).
        
    - Incurs cost (Private Link pricing).
        
- **Use case**: "I want my Azure PaaS service (e.g., Storage) to behave like a private resource in my VNet."
    

### 3. Private Link

- **What it is**: The **underlying technology** that enables Private Endpoints.
    
- **Key points**:
    
    - Private Link is the service; Private Endpoint is the resource you create.
        
    - Allows access to Azure services **or your own services** (via Private Link Service).
        
    - Supports cross-VNet/on-prem access (with DNS configuration).
        
- **Use case**: "I want to expose my own service privately to other VNets or customers."

### Example Scenario

- **Service Endpoint**: Your VM in VNet-A accesses `storage1.blob.core.windows.net` via Microsoft's network (not public internet).
    
- **Private Endpoint**: You assign `10.0.0.5` in VNet-A to `storage1`. Now you access it via `10.0.0.5` (fully private).
    
- **Private Link**: You publish your custom app (running in VNet-B) so others can access it privately via their own Private Endpoints.
    

### Key Takeaway

- Use **Service Endpoints** for simple VNet-to-PaaS security (free).
    
- Use **Private Endpoints** when you need private IPs for Azure services (most secure, paid).
    
- Use **Private Link** to expose **your own services** privately.
