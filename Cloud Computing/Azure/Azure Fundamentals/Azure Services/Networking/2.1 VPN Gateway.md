VPN Gateway helps you create encrypted cross-premises connections to your virtual network from on-premises locations, or create encrypted connections between VNets. There are different configurations available for VPN Gateway connections. Some of the main features include:

- Site-to-site VPN connectivity
- Point-to-site VPN connectivity
- VNet-to-VNet VPN connectivity

The following diagram illustrates multiple site-to-site VPN connections to the same virtual network. To view more connection diagrams, seeÂ [VPN Gateway - design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/design).
