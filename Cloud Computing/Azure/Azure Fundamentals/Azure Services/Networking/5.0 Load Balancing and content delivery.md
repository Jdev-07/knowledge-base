# Load Balancer

[Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) provides high-performance, low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing for all UDP and TCP protocols. It manages inbound and outbound connections. You can configure public and internal load-balanced endpoints. You can define rules to map inbound connections to back-end pool destinations by using TCP and HTTP health-probing options to manage service availability.

Azure Load Balancer is available in Standard, Regional, and Gateway SKUs.

The following picture shows an Internet-facing multi-tier application that utilizes both external and internal load balancers:

Azure Load Balancer is a cloud service that distributes incoming network traffic across backend virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS). This article explains Azure Load Balancer's key features, architecture, and scenarios, helping you decide if it fits your organization's load balancing needs for scalable, highly available workloads.

_Load balancing_ refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS).

## Load balancer overview

Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. The service distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's frontend to backend pool instances. These flows are distributed according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets.

A [public load balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations) can provide both inbound and outbound connectivity for the VMs inside your virtual network. For inbound traffic scenarios, Azure Load Balancer can load balance internet traffic to your VMs. For outbound traffic scenarios, the service can translate the VMs' private IP addresses to public IP addresses for any outbound connections that originate from your VMs.

Alternatively, an [internal (or private) load balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations) are used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network. With internal load balancer, you can provide inbound connectivity to your VMs in private network connectivity scenarios, such as accessing a load balancer frontend from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario.

## Why use Azure Load Balancer

With Azure Load Balancer, you can scale your applications and create highly available services. The service supports both inbound and outbound scenarios, provides low latency and high throughput, and scales up to millions of flows for all TCP and UDP applications.

### Core capabilities

Azure Load Balancer provides:

- **High availability**: Distribute resources [within](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-public-zonal-portal) and [across](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-portal) availability zones
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of flows for TCP and UDP applications
- **Low latency**: Use pass-through load balancing for ultralow latency
- **Flexibility**: Support for [multiple ports, multiple IP addresses, or both](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-multivip-overview)
- **Health monitoring**: Use [health probes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview) to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances

# Application Gateway

[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It's an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service, offering various layer 7 load-balancing capabilities for your applications.

![[net-013.png]]

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.

Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if `/images` is in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If `/video` is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos.

This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing. Azure Application Gateway can do URL-based routing and more.

Azure provides a suite of fully managed load-balancing solutions for your scenarios.

- If you're looking to do DNS based global routing and do **not** have requirements for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination ("SSL offload"), per-HTTP/HTTPS request or application-layer processing, review [Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview).
- If you need to optimize global routing of your web traffic and optimize top-tier end-user performance and reliability through quick global failover, see [Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview).
- To do transport layer load balancing, review [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview).

Your end-to-end scenarios may benefit from combining these solutions as needed.
