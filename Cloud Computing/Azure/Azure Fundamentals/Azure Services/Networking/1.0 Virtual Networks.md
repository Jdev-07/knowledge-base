Azure Virtual Network is the fundamentals building block for your private network in Azure. This service enables Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs) to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Virtual networks deliver the scale, availability, and isolation benefits of Azure infrastructure while maintaining the familiar networking concepts you use in traditional datacenters.

## Why use an Azure Virtual Network? 

Key scenarios that you can accomplish with a virtual network include:

- Communication of Azure resources with the internet.
    
- Communication between Azure resources.
    
- Communication with on-premises resources.
    
- Filtering of network traffic.
    
- Routing of network traffic.
    
- Integration with Azure services.

### Communicate with the internet

All resources in a virtual network can communicate outbound with the internet, by default. You can also use a [public IP address](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address), [NAT gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-overview), or [public load balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to manage your [outbound connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections). You can communicate inbound with a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public load balancer.

When you're using only an [internal standard load balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview), outbound connectivity isn't available until you define how you want outbound connections to work with an instance-level public IP address or a public load balancer.

### Communicate between Azure resources

Azure resources communicate securely with each other in one of the following ways:

- **Virtual network**: You can deploy VMs and other types of Azure resources in a virtual network. Examples of resources include App Service Environments, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy in a virtual network, see [Deploy dedicated Azure services into virtual networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services).
- **Virtual network service endpoint**: You can extend your virtual network's private address space and the identity of your virtual network to Azure service resources over a direct connection. Examples of resources include Azure Storage accounts and Azure SQL Database. Service endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only a virtual network. To learn more, see [Virtual network service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).
- **Virtual network peering**: You can connect virtual networks to each other by using virtual peering. The resources in either virtual network can then communicate with each other. The virtual networks that you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. To learn more, see [Virtual network peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

### Communicate with on-premises resources

You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network by using any of the following options:

- **Point-to-site virtual private network (VPN)**: Established between a virtual network and a single computer in your network. Each computer that wants to establish connectivity with a virtual network must configure its connection. This connection type is useful if you're just getting started with Azure, or for developers, because it requires few or no changes to an existing network. The communication between your computer and a virtual network is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet. To learn more, see [About point-to-site VPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#).
    
- **Site-to-site VPN**: Established between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN gateway deployed in a virtual network. This connection type enables any on-premises resource that you authorize to access a virtual network. The communication between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN gateway is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet. To learn more, see [Site-to-site VPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/design?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#s2smulti).
    
- **Azure ExpressRoute**: Established between your network and Azure, through an ExpressRoute partner. This connection is private. Traffic doesn't go over the internet. To learn more, see [What is Azure ExpressRoute?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json).
## Filter Network Traffic

You can filter network traffic between subnets by using either or both of the following options:

- **Network security groups**: Network security groups and application security groups can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. These rules enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. To learn more, see [Network security groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) and [Application security groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/application-security-groups).
    
- **Network virtual appliances**: A network virtual appliance is a virtual machine that performs a network function, such as a firewall or WAN optimization. To view a list of available network virtual appliances that you can deploy in a virtual network, go to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/networking?page=1&subcategories=appliances).

## Route network traffic

Azure routes traffic between subnets, connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet, by default. You can implement either or both of the following options to override the default routes that Azure creates:

- **Route tables**: You can create [custom route tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#user-defined) that control where traffic is routed to for each subnet.
    
- **Border gateway protocol (BGP) routes**: If you connect your virtual network to your on-premises network by using an [Azure VPN gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-bgp-overview?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) or an [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#dynamic-route-exchange) connection, you can propagate your on-premises BGP routes to your virtual networks.

## Integrate with Azure Services

Integrating Azure services with an Azure virtual network enables private access to the service from virtual machines or compute resources in the virtual network. You can use the following options for this integration:

- Deploy [dedicated instances of the service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services) into a virtual network. The services can then be privately accessed within the virtual network and from on-premises networks.
    
- Use [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) to privately access a specific instance of the service from your virtual network and from on-premises networks.
    
- Access the service over public endpoints by extending a virtual network to the service, through [service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview). Service endpoints allow service resources to be secured to the virtual network.

# Azure Virtual Network concepts and best practices

## Virtual Network Concepts

- **Address space:** When creating a virtual network, you must specify a custom private IP address space using public and private (RFC 1918) addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign. For example, if you deploy a VM in a virtual network with address space, 10.0.0.0/16, the VM is assigned a private IP like 10.0.0.4.
    
- **Subnets:** Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. You can then deploy Azure resources in a specific subnet. Just like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your virtual network address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization's internal network. Segmentation improves address allocation efficiency. You can secure resources within subnets using Network Security Groups. For more information, see [Network security groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).
    
- **Regions**: A virtual network is scoped to a single region/location; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected together using Virtual Network Peering.
    
- **Subscription:** A virtual network is scoped to a subscription. You can implement multiple virtual networks within each Azure [subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-glossary-cloud-terminology?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#subscription) and Azure [region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-glossary-cloud-terminology?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#region).

## Best Practices

As you build your network in Azure, it's important to keep in mind the following universal design principles:

- Ensure address spaces don't overlap. Make sure your virtual network address space (CIDR block) doesn't overlap with your organization's other network ranges.
    
- Your subnets shouldn't cover the entire address space of the virtual network. Plan ahead and reserve some address space for the future.
    
- Use a few large virtual networks instead of multiple small ones to reduce management overhead.
    
- Secure your virtual networks by assigning Network Security Groups (NSGs) to the subnets beneath them. For more information about network security concepts, see [Azure network security overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/network-overview).
