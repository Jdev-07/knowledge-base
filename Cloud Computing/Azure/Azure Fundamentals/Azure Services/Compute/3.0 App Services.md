Azure App Service is a platform that lets you run web applications, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Think of it as a powerful web hosting service that takes care of all the heavy lifting for you, so can focus on creating great applications.

App Service supports a variety of web stacks: .NET, Java (in Java SE, Tomcat, and JBoss flavors), Node.js, Python, and PHP, and can run them on both Windows and Linux. Or, if your app is containerized, you can just deploy it as a custom container.

## App Service Plan

An _Azure App Service plan_ defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. An app service always runs in an App Service plan. [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan) also has the option of running in an App Service plan.

When you create an App Service plan in a certain region, you create a set of compute resources for that plan in that region. Whatever apps you put into the App Service plan run on those compute resources, as defined in the plan.

Each App Service plan defines:

- Operating system (Windows, Linux)
- Region (West US, East US, and so on)
- Number of virtual machine (VM) instances
- Size of VM instances (small, medium, large)
- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, PremiumV4 IsolatedV2)

### Pricing Tiers

The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines what **App Service features** you get and how much you pay for the plan. The pricing tiers available to your App Service plan depend on the operating system that you select when you create it. This table shows the categories of pricing tiers:

| Category          | Tiers                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared compute    | Free, Shared                                              | Free and Shared, the two base tiers, run an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources. The resources can't scale out. These tiers are intended for only development and testing purposes. |
| Dedicated compute | Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, PremiumV4 | The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, and PremiumV4 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances that are available to you for scale-out.                                                |
| Isolated          | IsolatedV2                                                | The IsolatedV2 tier runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure virtual networks. This tier provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.                                                                                                     |
Each tier also provides a specific subset of App Service features. These features include custom domains and TLS/SSL certificates, autoscaling, deployment slots, backups, Azure Traffic Manager integration, and more. The higher the tier, the more features that are available. To find out which features are supported in each pricing tier, see the [App Service plan details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/#pricing).

### Considerations for running and scaling an app

In the Free and Shared tiers, an app receives CPU minutes on a shared VM instance and can't scale out.

In other tiers, an app runs and scales as follows:

- If you create an app in App Service, it's part of an App Service plan. When the app runs, it runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
- If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances.
- If you have multiple deployment slots for an app, all deployment slots also run on the same VM instances.
- If you enable diagnostic logs, perform backups, or run [WebJobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create), they also use CPU cycles and memory on these VM instances.
- All apps in an App Service plan scale together, because they share the same underlying compute resources (VM instances). Scaling the plan — whether manually or through autoscale rules — affects all apps in the plan.

### Cost of App Service plans

This section describes how App Service apps are billed. For detailed, region-specific pricing information, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

Except for the Free tier, an App Service plan carries a charge on the compute resources that it uses:

- **Shared tier**: Each app receives a quota of CPU minutes, so _each app_ is charged for the CPU quota.
- **Dedicated compute tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, PremiumV4)**: The App Service plan defines the number of VM instances that the apps are scaled to, so _each VM instance_ in the App Service plan is charged. These VM instances are charged the same, regardless of how many apps are running on them. To avoid unexpected charges, see [Delete an App Service plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-plan-manage#delete-an-app-service-plan).
- **IsolatedV2 tier**: The App Service Environment defines the number of isolated workers that run your apps, and _each worker_ is charged.

You aren't charged for using the App Service features that are available to you. These features include configuring custom domains, TLS/SSL certificates, deployment slots, and backups. The exceptions are:

- **App Service domains**: You pay when you purchase one in Azure and when you renew it each year.
- **App Service certificates**: You pay when you purchase one in Azure and when you renew it each year.
- **IP-based TLS connections**: There's an hourly charge for each IP-based TLS connection, but some Standard or higher tiers give you one IP-based TLS connection for free. Server Name Indication (SNI)-based TLS connections are free.

If you integrate App Service with another Azure service, you might need to consider charges from that service. For example, if you use Azure Traffic Manager to scale your app geographically, Traffic Manager also charges you based on your usage. To estimate your cross-services cost in Azure, see [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

### Scaling for capabilities or features

You can scale your App Service plan up or down at any time. It's as simple as changing the pricing tier of the plan. You can choose a lower pricing tier at first, and then scale up later when you need more App Service features.

For example, you can start testing your web app in a Free-tier App Service plan and pay nothing. When you add your [custom DNS name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain) to the web app, just scale your plan up to the Shared tier. Later, when you want to [create a TLS binding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings), scale your plan up to the Basic tier. When you want to have [staging environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots), scale up to the Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, scale up to a bigger VM size in the same tier.

The same process works in reverse. When you no longer need the capabilities or features of a higher tier, you can scale down to a lower tier and save money.

For more information on scaling up an App Service plan, see [Scale up an app in Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-scale-up)
If your app is in the same App Service plan with other apps, you might want to improve the app's performance by isolating the compute resources. You can isolate the resources by [moving the app to a separate App Service plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-plan-manage#move-an-app-to-another-app-service-plan).

### Decision to use a new plan or an existing plan for an app

You pay for the computing resources that your App Service plan allocates as described in the [earlier section about cost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans#cost). You can potentially save money by putting multiple apps into one App Service plan. You can continue to add apps to an existing plan as long as the plan has enough resources to handle the load.

However, keep in mind that apps in the same App Service plan all share the same compute resources. To determine whether the new app has the necessary resources, you need to understand the capacity of the existing App Service plan, along with the expected load for the new app. Overloading an App Service plan can cause downtime for your new and existing apps. You can find more comparisons between plans at [App Service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-app-service-limits).

Isolate your app in a new App Service plan when:

- The app is resource intensive. For general guidance, use this table:

|App Service plan|Maximum apps|
|---|---|
|B1, S1, P1v2, I1v1|8|
|B2, S2, P2v2, I2v1|16|
|B3, S3, P3v2, I3v1|32|
|P0v3, P0v4|8|
|P1v3, P1v4, I1v2|16|
|P2v3, P2v4, I2v2, P1mv3, P1mv4|32|
|P3v3, P3v4, I3v2, P2mv3|64|
|I4v2, I5v2, I6v2|Maximum density bound by vCPU usage|
|P3mv3, P3mv4, P4mv3, P4mv4, P5mv3, P5mv4|Maximum density bound by vCPU usage|
## App Service Environment

An App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a **fully isolated and dedicated environment** for running App Service apps securely at high scale. Unlike the App Service public multitenant offering where supporting infrastructure is shared, with App Service Environment, compute is dedicated to a single customer. For more information, see [App Service Environment v3 and App Service public multitenant comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/ase-multi-tenant-comparison).

An App Service Environment provides hosting capabilities for various workloads:

- Windows web apps
    
- Linux web apps
    
- Docker containers (Windows and Linux)
    
- Functions
    
- Logic apps (standard) in [supported regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=logic-apps&regions=all)
    

App Service Environments are designed to support application workloads that require specific performance and security features:

- High scale.
    
- Isolation and secure network access.
    
- High memory utilization.
    
- High requests per second (RPS). You can create multiple App Service Environments in a single Azure region or across multiple Azure regions. This flexibility makes an App Service Environment ideal for horizontally scaling stateless applications that have a high RPS requirement.
    

An App Service Environment hosts applications for a single customer on one of their virtual networks. Customers have fine-grained control over inbound and outbound application network traffic. Applications can establish high-speed secure connections over virtual private networks to on-premises corporate resources.

### Usage scenarios

App Service Environments have many use cases:

- Internal line-of-business applications
    
- Applications that need more than 30 App Service plan instances
    
- Single-tenant systems to satisfy internal compliance or security requirements
    
- Network-isolated application hosting
    
- Multiple-tier applications
    

There are many networking features that enable apps in a multitenant App Service to reach network-isolated resources or become network-isolated themselves. These features are enabled at the application level. With an App Service Environment, apps don't require extra configuration to be on a virtual network. The apps are deployed into a network-isolated environment that's already on a virtual network. If you need a complete isolation story, you can also deploy your App Service Environment on dedicated hardware.

### Dedicated environment

An App Service Environment is a single-tenant deployment of Azure App Service that runs on your virtual network.

Applications are hosted in App Service plans, which are created in an App Service Environment. An App Service plan serves as a provisioning profile for an application host. As you scale out your App Service plan, you add more application hosts, with all the apps in that App Service plan running on each host. A single App Service Environment v3 supports up to 200 total App Service plan instances across all the App Service plans combined. A single App Service Isolated v2 (Iv2) plan supports up to 100 instances on its own.

If you require physical isolation down to the hardware level, you can deploy your App Service Environment v3 on dedicated hosts. When you deploy on dedicated hosts, scaling across all App Service plans is limited to the number of available cores in this environment. An App Service Environment deployed on dedicated hosts has 132 vCores available. I1v2 uses two vCores, I2v2 uses four vCores, and I3v2 uses eight vCores for each instance. Only I1v2, I2v2, and I3v2 SKU sizes are available in an App Service Environment deployed on dedicated hosts. Extra charges apply for dedicated host deployments. Isolation down to the hardware level typically isn't a requirement for most customers, so consider the limitations of dedicated host deployments before you use this feature. To determine whether a dedicated host deployment is right for you, review your security and compliance requirements before deployment.

### Virtual network support

The App Service Environment feature is a deployment of Azure App Service into a single subnet within a virtual network. When you deploy an app into an App Service Environment, it's exposed on the inbound address that's assigned to the environment. If your App Service Environment is deployed with an internal virtual IP (VIP) address, the inbound address for all apps is an address within the App Service Environment subnet. If your App Service Environment is deployed with an external VIP address, the inbound address is an internet-accessible address, and your apps are listed in a public Domain Name System.

An App Service Environment v3 in its subnet uses a varying number of addresses, depending on the number of instances and the amount of traffic. Some infrastructure roles are automatically scaled, depending on the number of App Service plans and the load. A `/24` Classless Inter-Domain Routing block that has 256 addresses in it is the recommended size for your App Service Environment v3 subnet. That size can host an App Service Environment v3 that's scaled out to its limit.

The apps in an App Service Environment don't need any features enabled to access resources on the same virtual network that the App Service Environment is in. If the App Service Environment virtual network is connected to another network, the apps in the App Service Environment can access resources in those extended networks. User configuration on the network can block traffic.

The multitenant version of Azure App Service includes numerous features that let your apps connect to various networks. With these networking features, your apps function as if they're deployed on a virtual network. Apps in an App Service Environment v3 don't require added configuration to run on the virtual network.

A key benefit of using an App Service Environment instead of a multitenant service is that network access controls for the App Service Environment-hosted apps exist outside the application configuration. In a multitenant service, you must enable the features on each app individually and use role-based access control or a policy to prevent configuration changes.

### Pricing

With App Service Environment v3, the pricing model varies depending on the type of App Service Environment deployment that you have. There are three pricing models:

- **App Service Environment v3:** If the App Service Environment is empty, there's a charge as though you have one instance of Windows I1v2. The one instance charge isn't an additive charge but is applied only if the App Service Environment is empty.
    
- **Zone redundant App Service Environment v3:** There's no added charge for availability zone support. The pricing model is the same as an App Service Environment that isn't zone redundant.
    
- **Dedicated host App Service Environment v3:** With a dedicated host deployment, you pay for two dedicated hosts at the time of App Service Environment v3 creation, based on our pricing. As you scale, you're charged a specialized Isolated v2 rate for each vCore. I1v2 uses two vCores, I2v2 uses four vCores, and I3v2 uses eight vCores for each instance.
    

Reserved Instance pricing for Isolated v2 is available and is described in [How reservation discounts apply to Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/reservation-discount-app-service). App Service and Reserved Instance pricing is available at [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) under the Isolated v2 plan.
