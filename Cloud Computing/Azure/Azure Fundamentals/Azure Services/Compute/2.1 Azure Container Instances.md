Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service runs the containers for you.

Containers are becoming the preferred way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run Linux or Windows containers in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service.

ACI supports [regular](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups), [confidential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-confidential-overview), and [Spot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-spot-containers-overview) containers. ACI can be used as [single-instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups) or multi-instance via [NGroups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instance-ngroups/container-instances-about-ngroups), or you can get orchestration capabilities by deploying pods in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster via [virtual nodes on ACI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-virtual-nodes). For even faster startup times, ACI supports [standby pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-standby-pool-overview).

## Fast startup times

Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs). Azure Container Instances can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs.

Bring Linux or Windows container images from Docker Hub, a private [Azure container registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/), or another cloud-based Docker registry. Visit the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-faq) to learn which registries ACI supports. Azure Container Instances caches several common base OS images, helping speed deployment of your custom application images.

## Container access

Azure Container Instances enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). When you create a container instance, you can specify a custom DNS name label so your application is reachable at _customlabel_._azureregion_.azurecontainer.io.

Azure Container Instances also supports executing a command in a running container by providing an interactive shell to help with application development and troubleshooting. Access takes places over HTTPS, using TLS to secure client connections.

## Compliant deployments

### Hypervisor-level security

Historically, containers offered application dependency isolation and resource governance but were insufficiently hardened for hostile multitenant usage. Azure Container Instances guarantees your application is as isolated in a container as it would be in a VM.

### Customer data

The Azure Container Instances service doesn't store customer data. It does, however, store the subscription IDs of the Azure subscription used to create resources. Storing subscription IDs is required to ensure your container groups continue running as expected.

### Custom sizes

Containers are typically optimized to run just a single application, but the exact needs of those applications can differ greatly. Azure Container Instances provides optimum utilization by allowing exact specifications of CPU cores and memory. You pay based on what you need and get billed by the second, so you can fine-tune your spending based on actual need.

### Persistent storage

To retrieve and persist state with Azure Container Instances, we offer direct [mounting of Azure Files shares](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-azure-files) backed by Azure Storage.

### Linux and Windows containers

Azure Container Instances can schedule both Windows and Linux containers with the same API. You can specify your OS type preference when you create your [container groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups).

Some features are currently restricted to Linux containers:

- Multiple containers per container group
- Volume mounting ([Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-azure-files), [emptyDir](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-emptydir), [GitRepo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-gitrepo), [secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-secret))
- [Resource usage metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/monitor-azure-container-instances#get-metrics) with Azure Monitor
- [GPU resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-gpu) (preview)

For Windows container deployments, use images based on common [Windows base images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-faq#what-windows-base-os-images-are-supported-).

### Run multiple containers in a single container group

Azure Container Instances supports scheduling of [multiple containers within a single container group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups) that share the same container host, local network, storage, and lifecycle. This enables you to combine your main application container with other supporting role containers, such as logging sidecars.

### Virtual Network Deployment

Azure Container Instances enables [deployment of container instances into an Azure virtual network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-vnet). When deployed into a subnet within your virtual network, container instances can communicate securely with other resources in the virtual network, including those that are on premises (through [VPN gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)).


### Spot container deployment

ACI Spot containers allow customers to run interruptible, containerized workloads on unused Azure capacity at discounted prices of up to 70% compared to regular-priority ACI containers. ACI spot containers may be preempted when Azure encounters a shortage of surplus capacity, and they're suitable for workloads without strict availability requirements. Customers are billed for per-second memory and core usage. To utilize ACI Spot containers, you can deploy your workload with a specific property flag indicating that you want to use Spot container groups and take advantage of the discounted pricing model. For more information, see [Spot container groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-spot-containers-overview).


### NGroups

NGroups provides advanced capabilities for managing multiple related container groups. NGroups provides support for maintaining a specified number of container groups, performing rolling upgrades, deploying across multiple availability zones, using load balancers for ingress, and deploying confidential containers. For more information, see [About NGroups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instance-ngroups/container-instances-about-ngroups).
