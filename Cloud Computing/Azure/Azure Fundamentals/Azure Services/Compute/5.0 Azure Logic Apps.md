Azure Logic Apps is a cloud platform where you can create and run automated workflows in, across, and outside the software ecosystems in your enterprise or organization. This platform greatly reduces or removes the need to write code when your workflows must connect and work with resources from different components, such as services, systems, apps, and data sources.

Azure Logic Apps includes low-code-no-code tools for you to work with legacy, modern, and cutting-edge systems that exist in the cloud, on premises, or in hybrid environments. For example, you use a visual designer along with prebuilt operations to make building workflows as easy as possible. These prebuilt operations act as the building blocks in your workflows by giving you access to various resources and completing common tasks, such as getting data, sending data, and managing data. With Azure Logic Apps, you can build integration solutions that scale and support the business scenarios for your enterprise or organization's needs.

The following examples describe only a sample of tasks, business processes, and workloads that you can automate with Azure Logic Apps:

- Schedule and send email notifications using Office 365 when a specific event happens, for example, a new file is uploaded.
- Route and process customer orders across on-premises systems and cloud services.
- Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure Blob Storage.
- Monitor social media activity, analyze the sentiment, and create alerts or tasks for items that need review.

The following example workflow uses conditions and switches to determine the next action. Suppose you have an order system, and your workflow processes incoming orders. You want to manually review orders above a certain cost. Your workflow already has steps that determine the cost from an incoming order. So, you add a condition that compares each order to your cost threshold, for example:

| **Logic app**           | The Azure resource that you create when you want to build a workflow. Basically, you can create the following types of logic app resources:  <br>  <br>- A **Consumption** logic app resource that supports a single workflow, which is hosted and run in multitenant Azure Logic Apps  <br>  <br>- A **Standard** logic app resource that supports multiple workflows, which are hosted and run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, App Service Environment (ASE) v3 - Windows plans only, or a partially connected environment  <br>  <br>Learn more about [logic app resource types along with their respective computing resource and billing models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview#resource-environment-differences).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Workflow**            | A series of operations that define a task, business process, or workload. Each workflow always starts with a single trigger operation, after which you must add one or more action operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Trigger**             | The first operation in any workflow that specifies the criteria to meet before running any subsequent operations in that workflow. For example, a trigger event might be getting an email in your inbox or detecting a new file in a storage account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Action**              | Each subsequent operation that follows the trigger in the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Built-in connector**  | This connector or operation type is "built in" to the Azure Logic Apps runtime so that operations run natively and directly along with the runtime for faster performance, compared to Microsoft-managed connectors that are hosted and run in Azure.  <br>  <br>Built-in operations provide ways for you to control your workflow's schedule or structure, run your own code, manage and manipulate data, send or receive requests to an endpoint, and complete other tasks in your workflow.  <br>  <br>For example, you can start almost any workflow on a schedule when you use the **Recurrence** trigger. Or, you can have your workflow wait until called when you use the **Request** trigger. These operations don't usually require that you create a connection from your workflow.  <br>  <br>While most built-in operations aren't associated with any service or system, some built-in operations are available for specific services, such as Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, Azure App Service, and more. The availability for these built-in operations depends on whether you're working on a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow. For more information and examples, see [Built-in connectors for Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/built-in). |
| **Managed connector**   | This connector or operation type is Microsoft-published, managed, hosted, and run in Azure and is a prebuilt proxy or wrapper for a service or system's REST API, which you can use to access a specific app, data, service, or system. Before you can use most managed connectors, you must first create a connection from your workflow and authenticate your identity.  <br>  <br>For example, you can start your workflow with a trigger or run an action that works with a service such as Office 365, Salesforce, or file servers. For more information, see [Managed connectors for Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/managed).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Integration account** | Create this Azure resource when you want to define and store B2B artifacts for use in your workflows. After you [create and link an integration account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account) to your logic app, your workflows can use these B2B artifacts. Your workflows can also exchange messages that follow Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) standards.  <br>  <br>For example, you can define trading partners, agreements, schemas, maps, and other B2B artifacts. You can create workflows that use these artifacts and exchange messages over protocols such as AS2, EDIFACT, X12, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
