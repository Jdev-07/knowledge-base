Azure Container Apps are similar in many ways to a container instance. They allow you to get up and running right away, they **remove the container management piece**, and they're a PaaS offering. Container Apps have extra benefits such as the ability to incorporate **load balancing** and scaling. These other functions allow you to be more **elastic** in your design.

Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that allows you to maintain less infrastructure and save costs while running containerized applications. Instead of worrying about server configuration, container orchestration, and deployment details, Container Apps provides all the up-to-date server resources required to keep your applications stable and secure.

Common uses of Azure Container Apps include:

- Deploying API endpoints
- Hosting background processing jobs
- Handling event-driven processing
- Running microservices

Additionally, applications built on Azure Container Apps can dynamically scale based on the following characteristics:

- HTTP traffic
- Event-driven processing
- CPU or memory load
- AnyÂ [KEDA-supported scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/)
