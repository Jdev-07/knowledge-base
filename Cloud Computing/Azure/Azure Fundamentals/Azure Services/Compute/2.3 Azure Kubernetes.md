Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a container orchestration service. An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers. When you're deploying a fleet of containers, AKS can make fleet management simpler and more efficient.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

A cluster in AKS is like a team of computers, called nodes working together to run your apps.

- Control Plane: This is the brain of the cluster who decides where to run the app, when to scale it up or down and how to keep it healthy
- Nodes: These are the actual machines that run your app containers. 

| Component     | Role                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control Plane | Manages the cluster, schedules apps, handles updates and scaling     |
| Nodes         | Run your app containers (each node can run many containers)          |
| Pods          | The smallest unit in Kubernetes—each pod runs one or more containers |
| Services      | Expose your app to the internet or other apps                        |
| Ingress       | Advanced traffic routing (like a smart gatekeeper)                   |
