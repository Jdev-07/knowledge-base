Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. If you build an app using VMs or containers, those resources have to be “running” in order for your app to function. With Azure Functions, an event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events.

Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to build robust apps while using less code, and with less infrastructure and lower costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, you can use the cloud infrastructure to provide all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

You focus on the code that matters most to you, in the most productive language for you, and Azure Functions handles the rest. For a list of supported languages, see [Supported languages in Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages).

## Scenarios

Functions provides a comprehensive set of event-driven [triggers and bindings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings) that connect your functions to other services without having to write extra code.

The following list includes common integrated scenarios that use Function

## Development Lifecycle

With Functions, you write your function code in your preferred language using your favorite development tools, and then deploy your code to the Azure cloud. Functions provides native support for developing in [C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages), plus the ability to use [custom handlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers) for other languages, such as Rust and Go.

Functions integrates directly with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Maven, and other popular development tools to enable seamless debugging and [deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies).

Functions also integrates with Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis of your [functions in the cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring).

## Hosting optiosn

Functions provides various [hosting options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale) for your business needs and application workload. [Event-driven scaling hosting options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/event-driven-scaling) range from fully serverless, where you only pay for execution time (Consumption plan), to always-warm instances kept ready for the fastest response times (Premium plan).

When you have excess App Service hosting resources, you can host your functions in an existing App Service plan. This kind of Dedicated hosting plan is also a good choice when you need predictable scaling behaviors and costs from your functions.

If you want complete control over your runtime environment and dependencies, you can even deploy your functions in containers that you can fully customize. Your custom containers can be hosted by Functions, deployed as part of a microservices architecture in Azure Container Apps, or even self-hosted in Kubernetes.
