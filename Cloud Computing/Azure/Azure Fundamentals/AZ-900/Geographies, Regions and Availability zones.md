A group of data centers that are connected with each other high throughput internet connectivity are called regions.  In Azure, the regions are globally distributed. 


When choosing a region with need to select the closer to our clients. Closer you are to your clients lower the latency between the servers and your clients.

## Region

Region is simply a geographical area on the planet. One but usually more datacenters connected with low-latency network (<2 ms.)

Some services are called global services because do not have any region and specific location assigned.

Products Available by Regions

## Availability Zones

Zonal services and Zone-redundant services.

Not all regions support Availability Zones.

## Region Pairs

Paired regions are at least 300 miles away from each other. Region pairs are static and cannot be chosen. Also, each pair resides within the same geography. The regions are not always in the same country but close enough to have a high speed connectivity but far enough to ensure that level disasters will take them down.
