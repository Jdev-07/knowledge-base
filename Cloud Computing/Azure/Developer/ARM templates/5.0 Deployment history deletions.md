When you deploy resources to Azure, the deployment details are recorded in the deployment history at the scope where the deployment occurs. Each scope—whether it's a [resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-resource-group), [subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription), [management group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-management-group), [tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-tenant)—can store up to **800 deployments** in its history. Once this limit is reached, Azure **automatically deletes the oldest deployments** to make space for new ones. This automatic cleanup process was implemented on **August 6, 2020**.

**Note:** Deleting a deployment from the history doesn't affect any of the resources that were deployed.

## Automatic deployment history deletions

Deployments are deleted from your history when you exceed 700 deployments. Azure Resource Manager deletes deployments until the history is down to 600. The oldest deployments are always deleted first.

**Important:** If your scope is already at the 800 limit, your next deployment fails with an error. The automatic deletion process starts immediately. You can try your deployment again after a short wait.
